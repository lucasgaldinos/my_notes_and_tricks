# Problem

commits going directly into the repo via remote.

## why?

The answer is simple. When one commit on the main branch, it's like the user was commiting on "prod" instead of just commiting to a branch. This eliminates the need for creating pull-requests. It can be useful for personal projects, but not for something like an app or softwares that have a user base.
